# Getting started

## Updating git submodules

You can run the following commands to make sure submodules
are populated with proper code.

```shell
git submodule sync --recursive
git submodule update --recursive --init --force
```

## Building the Deployment Container

```
export GCP_PROJECT=neo4j-k8s-marketplace-public
docker build \
   -t gcr.io/$GCP_PROJECT/neo4j-deployer:latest \
   -f neo4j-installer/Dockerfile .
gcloud docker -- push gcr.io/$GCP_PROJECT/neo4j-deployer:latest
```

## Running the Deployer Container

k8s marketplace will do it live.

```
DEPLOYER_IMAGE=gcr.io/neo4j-k8s-marketplace-public/neo4j-deployer:latest
vendor/marketplace-k8s-app-tools/scripts/start.sh --deployer=$DEPLOYERÂ­_IMAGE \
   --parameters='{"NAMESPACE": "default", "APP_INSTANCE_NAME": "mygraph"}'
